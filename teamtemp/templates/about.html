    <p>
      This application is designed to gather 'team temperature' - that is,
      our happiness score.</p>

    <p>For your privacy, very little information is stored or recorded.
      Each submitter is represented by an anonymous random ID, and a cookie is stored
      only to protect against accidental double submissions from the
      same user with the same browser.</p>

    <p>The results page is available to the owner using the same cookie
      mechanism as well as a password in case the cookie is removed.</p>

    <p>It is deployed at <a href="https://dcp-team-temp.herokuapp.com//">dcp-team-temp.herokuapp.com</a>
      hosted on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a></p>
