      This application is designed to gather 'team temperature' - that is,
      our happiness score.</p>

    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">For your privacy, very little information is stored or recorded.
      Each submitter is represented by an anonymous random ID, and a cookie is stored
      only to protect against accidental double submissions from the
      same user with the same browser.</p>

    <p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Think of this as your opportunity to have a vent, or share 
      your happiness without anyone knowing it's you!</p>
