    <h1>About Team Temperature</h1>
    <p>
      This application is designed to gather 'team temperature' - that is,
      our happiness score.</p>

    <p>For your privacy, very little information is stored or recorded.
      Each submitter is represented by an anonymous random ID, and a cookie is stored
      only to protect against accidental double submissions from the
      same user with the same browser.</p>

    <p>The results page is available to the owner using the same cookie
      mechanism as well as a password in case the cookie is removed.</p>

    <p>It is deployed at <a href="https://teamtempapp.herokuapp.com/">teamtempapp.herokuapp.com</a>
      hosted on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and the source for this version
      can be examined <a href="https://github.com/rloomans/new-teamtemp">on Github</a>.
      All reasonable pull requests will be considered, as will any issues raised.</p>

    <p>The application is written in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>
      against a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database.</p>
